# Section Builder

Section builder is a page template and theme plugin that allows us to build 'sections' in pages.

What is Section Builder?  
1. VIP Ready and compliant.  
2. Fast.  
3. Easily customized and tweaked for clients needs.  
4. Decrease time dev needs to set up smaller projects.  
5. Built by me.  

A page can have as many sections as needed. Each Section is comprised a finite number of items. ( One item sections have one item, Two item sections have two items. ) This allows for easier styling since you will always know how many items to expect in a section. We can easily extend section builder by adding new "section types" or by adding new "item types". Currently there are four section types and one item type. The current item type consists of a link field, image field, title field, and an excerpt. As of now, it isn't as easy to add new sections as I would like. If you have ideas on the best way to abstract I would love to hear them, just submit a pull request.

The section types currently are:  
1. Hero Section (one item)  
2. One Item Section (one item)  
3. Two Item Section (two items)  
4. Three Item Section (three items)  

_But wait what if I need two sections with three items._ We can easily extend section builder to add a new setion type with as many items as needed.

Section Builder makes use of [Fieldmanager](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wordpress-fieldmanager). If you have never used Fieldmanager before, their [demo plugin](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/fieldmanager-demos/tree/master/lib) is a great place to see all the cool stuff it can do. This allows us to easily extend and customize the items in sections very quickly.
